# User Management in Jenkins

User management in Jenkins can be done through the web dashboard, and for more advanced configurations, you can integrate Jenkins with LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) for centralized user authentication and authorization. 

### Normal User Management in Jenkins:

**Step 1: Access Jenkins Dashboard**
1. Open your web browser and go to the Jenkins server's web interface (usually at `http://<your-server-IP>:8080`).
2. Log in as an administrator.

**Step 2: Create and Manage Users**
1. Click "Manage Jenkins" on the left-hand menu.
2. Click "Manage Users" to view and manage existing users.
3. To create a new user:
   - Click "Create User" and fill in the user details (username, password, full name, email, etc.).
   - Define the user's permissions (e.g., whether they can access certain jobs or perform administrative tasks).

**Step 3: Configure Global Security**
1. To manage security settings, go back to "Manage Jenkins" and click "Configure Global Security."
2. Configure the desired security realm. By default, Jenkins uses "Jenkins's own user database."

### LDAP-Based User Management in Jenkins:

Integrating Jenkins with LDAP is advantageous for large organizations or those with pre-existing LDAP directories for user management. It provides centralized user authentication and authorization.

**Step 1: Install the LDAP Plugin**
1. Access the Jenkins dashboard.
2. Click "Manage Jenkins" and then "Manage Plugins."
3. In the "Available" tab, search for "LDAP" and install the "LDAP" plugin.

**Step 2: Configure LDAP in Jenkins**
1. Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure Global Security."
2. In the "Security Realm" section, select "LDAP" from the dropdown.
3. Configure the LDAP settings:
   - **Server**: Specify the LDAP server address (e.g., ldap://ldap.example.com).
   - **Root DN**: The base DN where Jenkins should start searching for users (e.g., dc=example,dc=com).
   - **User Search Filter**: Define how Jenkins should search for users (e.g., uid={0}).
   - **Group Search Filter**: Specify how Jenkins should search for groups (e.g., cn={0}).
   - **Manager DN**: If needed, provide a DN with sufficient permissions to search for users and groups.
   - **Password**: The password for the Manager DN, if applicable.

**Step 3: Test and Save Configuration**
1. Click "Test LDAP Settings" to ensure that the connection to the LDAP server is working correctly.
2. Adjust any settings if needed, then save the configuration.

**Step 4: Authorization Strategy**
1. In the same security settings page, in the "Authorization" section, choose an authorization strategy that complements LDAP, e.g., "Matrix-based security" or "Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy."

**Advantages of Using LDAP-Based User Management:**

1. **Centralized User Management:** LDAP enables centralized user management across an organization. Users and groups are maintained in one location, simplifying account provisioning and maintenance.

2. **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Users can log in to Jenkins using their LDAP credentials, which promotes a single sign-on experience and reduces password fatigue.

3. **Security and Policy Enforcement:** LDAP allows you to enforce security policies consistently across all LDAP-connected systems. This ensures that security policies and access control are aligned.

4. **Group-based Authorization:** You can map LDAP groups to Jenkins roles and permissions, making it easier to control who can access which Jenkins jobs and perform various tasks.

5. **Reduced Administrative Overhead:** When a user's role or permissions change in the LDAP directory, the same changes are reflected in Jenkins without manual intervention.

6. **Scalability:** LDAP is suitable for larger organizations with many users. It can handle large user databases efficiently.

Using LDAP-based user management in Jenkins is especially beneficial for enterprises with complex user access control requirements and the need for centralized user management. It simplifies user provisioning, improves security, and streamlines the user authentication process.
