# Configuring tools in Jenkins

Configuring tools in Jenkins, such as different Java versions and Maven, is essential to ensure that your Jenkins jobs can build, test, and deploy projects correctly. 

1. **Access the Jenkins Dashboard:**
   - Log in to your Jenkins server's web interface.

2. **Go to Global Tool Configuration:**
   - Click on "Manage Jenkins" in the left-hand menu.

3. **Configure Tools:**

   a. **Java Installation:**
      - Scroll down to the "Global Tool Configuration" section and find the "JDK" section.
      - Click on "JDK installations..." to add or configure Java versions.
      - Click "Add JDK" and provide a name for the JDK installation (e.g., "Java 8").
      - Specify the JDK installation directory (e.g., `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk`).
      - You can add multiple Java versions by repeating the steps.
      - Save your configuration.

   b. **Maven Installation:**
      - In the "Global Tool Configuration" page, find the "Maven" section.
      - Click on "Maven installations..." to add or configure Maven installations.
      - Click "Add Maven" and provide a name for the Maven installation (e.g., "Maven 3.6.3").
      - Specify the Maven installation directory (e.g., `/usr/local/apache-maven-3.6.3`).
      - You can add multiple Maven versions by repeating the steps.
      - Save your configuration.

   c. **Other Tools (Optional):**
      - Depending on your project's requirements, you can configure other tools, such as Git, Ant, Gradle, or other build and deployment tools. These configurations are usually located in the same "Global Tool Configuration" page under the respective sections.

4. **Use Configured Tools in Your Jenkins Jobs:**

   a. **Java:**
      - In your Jenkins job configuration, select the specific Java version you want to use for the build or test environment. This option is typically available under the "Build Environment" or "Build" section of your job configuration.

   b. **Maven:**
      - In your Jenkins job configuration, specify which Maven installation to use. You can choose from the configured Maven versions in the "Build" or "Build Environment" section, depending on the job type.

5. **Save Your Jenkins Job Configuration:**
   - Save your Jenkins job configuration to apply the changes.

With these configurations in place, your Jenkins jobs will use the specified Java versions and Maven installations as required by your projects. This ensures consistency and compatibility in your build and test processes.
