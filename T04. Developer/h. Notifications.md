# Notifications

Notifications in Jenkins are essential for keeping your team and stakeholders informed about the status of your CI/CD pipelines. Jenkins provides various ways to send notifications, including email notifications, instant messaging, and integrations with other communication tools. Here's how to set up notifications in Jenkins:

1. **Email Notifications:**
   - Email notifications are a common way to alert team members about build and deployment status. To configure email notifications:

   a. **Access the Jenkins Dashboard:** Log in to your Jenkins server.

   b. **Go to Global Configuration:** Click on "Manage Jenkins" in the left-hand menu, and then select "Configure System."

   c. **Email Notification Settings:** Scroll down to the "E-mail Notification" section.

   d. **SMTP Server Configuration:** Configure your SMTP server settings, including the SMTP server hostname, credentials, and connection security.

   e. **Default Recipients:** You can define default recipients for build notifications.

   f. **Pipeline-Specific Notifications:** In your pipeline script, you can use the `emailext` step to send email notifications at specific stages in the pipeline.

   ```groovy
   stage('Deploy to Production') {
       steps {
           sh 'make deploy-prod'
           emailext (
               subject: 'Deployment Successful',
               body: 'The application has been deployed to production.',
               recipientProviders: [culprits(), requestor()],
           )
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Instant Messaging (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams):**
   - Jenkins can integrate with various instant messaging platforms. To set up instant messaging notifications:

   a. **Install Relevant Plugins:** Install the Jenkins plugins for your chosen platform, such as the "Slack Notification Plugin" or "Microsoft Teams Notification Plugin."

   b. **Configure the Plugin:** In your Jenkins job configuration, find the "Post-build Actions" section and add a post-build action to send notifications to your platform.

3. **Custom Webhooks and APIs:**
   - Jenkins can use webhooks and custom APIs to send notifications to various services. This method provides flexibility for integrating with specific systems. To set up custom notifications:

   a. **Write a Custom Script:** In your Jenkins pipeline script, you can use the `httpRequest` step to send HTTP requests to custom endpoints, such as webhooks.

   ```groovy
   stage('Deploy to Production') {
       steps {
           sh 'make deploy-prod'
           httpRequest (
               url: 'https://your-custom-webhook-url',
               httpMode: 'POST',
               requestBody: 'Deployment successful.'
           )
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Third-Party Notification Services:**
   - There are Jenkins plugins and services that offer integration with third-party notification services, such as PagerDuty or VictorOps.

   a. **Install the Relevant Plugin:** Install the Jenkins plugin for the third-party service you want to use.

   b. **Configure Plugin Settings:** Configure the plugin settings with your service's API key and other required information.

   c. **In Your Pipeline:** Add steps in your pipeline script to trigger notifications to the third-party service at specific stages.
