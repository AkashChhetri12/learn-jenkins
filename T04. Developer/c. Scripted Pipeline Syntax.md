# Scripted Pipeline Syntax

A Scripted Pipeline in Jenkins is defined using the Groovy scripting language. It offers more flexibility than Declarative Pipelines but requires a deeper understanding of Groovy and Jenkins pipeline syntax. 

```groovy
node {
    // Define variables and setup
    def someVariable = "Hello, Jenkins!"

    try {
        // Stage 1: Checkout source code
        stage('Checkout') {
            checkout scm
        }

        // Stage 2: Build
        stage('Build') {
            // Build steps here
            sh 'make'
        }

        // Stage 3: Test
        stage('Test') {
            // Test steps here
            sh 'make test'
        }

        // Additional stages as needed

    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle exceptions or errors
        currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'
        error("Pipeline failed: ${e.message}")
    } finally {
        // Post-build cleanup, notifications, etc.
        stage('Post-build') {
            // Post-build steps here
            echo "Post-build actions go here"
        }
    }
}
```

Here are the main elements of a Scripted Pipeline:

1. `node { ... }`: The `node` block specifies where the pipeline will run. In this example, `node` runs on any available agent.

2. Variable Definitions: You can define variables within the `node` block to store values and data that your pipeline will use.

3. `try { ... } catch (Exception e) { ... } finally { ... }`: This block is used to handle exceptions and errors. It allows you to gracefully handle errors and failures and execute cleanup tasks in the `finally` block.

4. `stage('Name') { ... }`: You can define multiple stages in your pipeline, each labeled with a name. Each stage typically contains the steps for a specific part of your build or deployment process.

5. Build Steps: The `sh` step is used to execute shell commands. You can run build, test, and deployment steps using `sh`, and you can also use other steps provided by Jenkins plugins.

6. Post-build Actions: After all stages are completed or in the `finally` block, you can define post-build actions, such as notifications or cleanup tasks.

7. `error(...)`: The `error` function is used to indicate pipeline failure and provide an error message.

Remember that Scripted Pipelines provide extensive flexibility, but they require careful scripting to handle various conditions and exceptions. The exact structure of your pipeline will depend on your project's requirements, tools, and processes.
