# Basic skeleton for a CI/CD pipeline

Designing a CI/CD pipeline often depends on the specific needs of your project and the tools and technologies you're using. However, I can provide a generic skeleton for a CI/CD pipeline and demonstrate how to create both a Declarative and Scripted Pipeline with multiple stages.

Here's a basic skeleton for a CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Checkout**: Retrieve the source code from a version control system (e.g., Git).

2. **Build**: Compile and build your application or code.

3. **Test**: Run unit tests and any other automated tests.

4. **Static Code Analysis**: Perform static code analysis to identify issues or violations (optional).

5. **Deploy to Development**: Deploy the application to a development environment for further testing and validation.

6. **Integration Tests**: Execute integration tests to ensure different components work together.

7. **Deploy to Staging**: Deploy the application to a staging environment for user acceptance testing (UAT).

8. **UAT**: Conduct user acceptance testing to validate the application's functionality.

9. **Deploy to Production**: Deploy the application to the production environment.

10. **Post-Deployment Steps**: Execute post-deployment tasks, such as database migrations or cache clearing.

11. **Notify Teams**: Send notifications to relevant teams or stakeholders.

Now, Here is a sample Declarative Pipeline and a sample Scripted Pipeline based on this generic skeleton. You can customize these pipelines further based on your project's specific requirements.

### Declarative Pipeline:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'make build'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'make test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy to Development') {
            steps {
                sh 'make deploy-dev'
            }
        }
        stage('Integration Tests') {
            steps {
                sh 'make integration-tests'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy to Staging') {
            steps {
                sh 'make deploy-staging'
            }
        }
        stage('UAT') {
            steps {
                sh 'make uat-tests'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy to Production') {
            steps {
                sh 'make deploy-prod'
            }
        }
        stage('Post-Deployment Steps') {
            steps {
                sh 'make post-deploy'
            }
        }
        stage('Notify Teams') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deployment completed.'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Scripted Pipeline:

```groovy
node {
    try {
        stage('Checkout') {
            checkout scm
        }
        stage('Build') {
            sh 'make build'
        }
        stage('Test') {
            sh 'make test'
        }
        stage('Deploy to Development') {
            sh 'make deploy-dev'
        }
        stage('Integration Tests') {
            sh 'make integration-tests'
        }
        stage('Deploy to Staging') {
            sh 'make deploy-staging'
        }
        stage('UAT') {
            sh 'make uat-tests'
        }
        stage('Deploy to Production') {
            sh 'make deploy-prod'
        }
        stage('Post-Deployment Steps') {
            sh 'make post-deploy'
        }
        stage('Notify Teams') {
            echo 'Deployment completed.'
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'
        error("Pipeline failed: ${e.message}")
    } finally {
        stage('Post-build Cleanup') {
            echo 'Perform any necessary post-build cleanup.'
        }
    }
}
```

These pipelines provide a basic structure that you can modify to fit your project's specific needs. You would replace the `sh` commands with the actual commands and steps required for your project. Additionally, you can introduce error handling, notifications, and more advanced features as necessary.
