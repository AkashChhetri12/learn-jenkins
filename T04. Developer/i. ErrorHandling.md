# Error handling in Jenkins

Error handling in Jenkins pipelines is crucial to ensure that your continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes are reliable and robust. Handling errors gracefully can prevent pipeline failures and allow for appropriate responses when things go wrong. There are several ways to implement error handling in Jenkins pipelines:

1. **Try-Catch Blocks (Scripted Pipeline):**
   In scripted pipelines, you can use Groovy's try-catch blocks to handle exceptions. This is useful when you want to gracefully handle errors in a specific stage or block of code.

   ```groovy
   node {
       try {
           stage('Build') {
               // Code that may throw an exception
               sh 'make build'
           }
           stage('Deploy') {
               sh 'make deploy'
           }
       } catch (Exception e) {
           currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'
           error("Pipeline failed: ${e.message}")
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Error-Handling Functions (Declarative Pipeline):**
   In Declarative pipelines, you can use the `catchError` and `error` functions to handle errors gracefully. These functions allow you to catch and handle specific types of errors within a stage.

   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Build') {
               steps {
                   catchError(buildResult: 'FAILURE') {
                       sh 'make build'
                   }
               }
           }
           stage('Deploy') {
               steps {
                   catchError(buildResult: 'FAILURE') {
                       sh 'make deploy'
                   }
               }
           }
       }
       post {
           failure {
               error("Pipeline failed due to a build or deployment error.")
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Retry Stages:**
   In Jenkins pipelines, you can use the `retry` step to retry a stage a certain number of times if it fails. This can be especially useful for transient failures.

   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Build') {
               steps {
                   retry(3) {
                       sh 'make build'
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Post-Build Actions:**
   Use the `post` block to specify actions that should occur after the pipeline completes, regardless of its outcome. You can send notifications, archive artifacts, or perform cleanup tasks.

   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Build') {
               steps {
                   sh 'make build'
               }
           }
           stage('Deploy') {
               steps {
                   sh 'make deploy'
               }
           }
       }
       post {
           always {
               archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'target/*.jar', allowEmptyArchive: true
           }
           failure {
               mail to: 'team@example.com', subject: 'Pipeline Failed', body: 'The pipeline has failed.'
           }
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Notification on Failure:**
   You can use the `emailext` or other notification steps in the event of a failure to send email notifications or integrate with other alerting systems.

   ```groovy
   stage('Deploy') {
       steps {
           catchError(buildResult: 'FAILURE') {
               sh 'make deploy'
           }
       }
       post {
           failure {
               emailext (
                   subject: 'Deployment Failed',
                   body: 'The deployment process failed.',
                   to: 'team@example.com',
               )
           }
       }
   }
   ```
